# Xamarin.ExoPlayerSlim

Slim bindings for [ExoPlayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer). Using the awesome [Xamarin.Binding.Helpers](https://github.com/Redth/Xamarin.Binding.Helpers) from Jonathan Dick ([@Redth](https://github.com/Redth)).

As this is a slim binding library, this repository is NOT aiming for full API coverage. Please see the java code located in https://github.com/thisisthekap/Xamarin.ExoPlayerSlim/tree/main/java/ExoPlayerSlim/exoplayerslim/src/main/java/com/tonestro/exoplayerslim on how the slim binding uses ExoPlayer.

## About this Repository

This repository is not going to support newer versions of the ExoPlayer SDK. For newer versions of the SDK, and support for .NET 8 iOS (MAUI), please see https://github.com/thisisthekap/Tonestro.Maui.ExoPlayerSlim.Android.

## Versioning Scheme

The versioning scheme of `Xamarin.ExoPlayerSlim` is derived from the versioning of [google/ExoPlayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer).

### Example:

| google/ExoPlayer | Xamarin.ExoPlayerSlim | Note |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 1.2.3 | 1.2.3.1 | First version of bindings for 1.2.3 |
| 1.2.3 | 1.2.3.17 | Bindings for 1.2.3 containing fixes |

### Troubleshooting

If you experience issues like `java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Didn't find class "androidx.core.app.CoreComponentFactory"` or `java.lang.NullPointerException: No suitable media source factory found for content type: 2`, extend your proguard configuration like this:

```
# needed to fix exoplayer video playback

-keep public class androidx.core.app.*
-keep public class androidx.appcompat.widget.*
-keep public class com.google.android.exoplayer2.** { *; }
```
